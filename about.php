					<p> Millhouse is a wholesale company that sells clothes, accessories and smaller interior design items to hundreds of fashion and lifestyle stores.
						<br/>
						<br/> The company was founded 60 years ago by Millhouse Simpson. His idea was that men and women everywhere should have the possibility to be welldresses at a reasonable price.
						<br/>
						<br/> Millhouse Simpsons successful business revolutionized the clothing industry and his thinking still affects many fashion campanies today.
						<br/>
						<br/> In the fall of 2017 Millhouse started our own webshop, selling our products directly to the consumers for the first time.
